# Inktober

## Summary

Quoting the [inktober FAQ](https://inktober.com/faq):
> Inktober is a month long art challenge created by artist Jake Parker that is focused on improving skill and developing positive drawing habits. Every day for the month of October anyone participating in the Inktober challenge creates an ink drawing and posts it online.

These are CSS implementations of the prompts. It's not in ink - which disqualifies it from the challenge - but it's still an opportunity to experiment and learn more from CSS.
